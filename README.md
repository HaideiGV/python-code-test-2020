# Ostmodern Python Code Test

The goal of this exercise is to test that you know your way around developing 
REST APIs in docker environment. You can use any rest framework and database 
of your choice.  Approach it the way you would an actual long-term project.

To start with, a Dockerfile (with Python3.7 Apline image) has been provided for you.


## Tasks

Your task is to build a JSON-based REST API for your frontend developers to
consume. You have built a list of user stories with your colleagues, but you get
to decide how to design the API. Remember that the frontend developers will need
some documentation of your API to understand how to use it.

We do not need you to implement users or authentication, to reduce the amount of
time this exercise will take to complete.
